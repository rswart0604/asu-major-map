# asu-major-map

A basic scraper and analyzer of major maps at ASU. Each major has a website with a mapping of its course per each term or semester. 
This repo takes that data and organizes it into lists. Other functions such as comparing courses between majors are provided.

In addition, there is basic charting which will take a major's courseload (or multiple majors' loads, if you choose to combine them) 
and display them to an svg.
